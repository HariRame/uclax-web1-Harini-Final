        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>

        <p>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <div>HTML is the abbreviation of Hyper Text MarkUp Language. The browser orders or places the content as defined in the html page. The content can be text, images, list, links,icons,headings, paragraphs. The root element is the HTML tag. It contains the HEAD and the Body tags where the page title/heading and the content are placed respectively.

            Each element has attributes like Id, class and name that provides information about the element. </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <div>CSS is the abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets. It controls how the content will be displayed in the browser ie,. the font size, color, thickness of the  border and padding etc. The css can be defined in-line under the STYLE tag in the HTML document or defined in the .css file and then imported in the HTML file. 

            It is good practice to maintain basic page format across the website and the .css files helps acheive that.  
            <p></p>
                &lt;style&gt;
                <div>
                    div {
                     color:blue;
                }
                </div>
                &lt;/style&gt; 
            
            <p>The above style will be applied to all the DIV tags in the HTML page. </p>
            </div>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Javascript</h3>
           <div>Javascript is the language that is used to make the site dynamic by adding functionalities to the html elements or by changing the css of an element or changing the element itself. It can also manipulate the data provided by user (for validation before passing to the server ) or data provided by the server(To display relevant information in the browser). </div>

        </p>
        <p>
         <h2>Q2. What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Single Page Application</h3>
            <div>
              
              Single Page Applications are websites in which client need not reload the entire page when there is a change in data (may or may not be due to uer action), only that particular resource is refreshed or reloaded.   
              <div>
              Example, In the Facebook application, when the user on the Home page, scrolls through it and then clicks the 'Like' button.
              </div>
              Here  <li>The user has changed data by clicking the button,</li> 
              <li>hence data is updated in the DB through the API's</li> 
              <li> then it should be seen on the page that the post is Liked. </li>

             <div> In  a single page application, All of the above steps occurs seemlessly without page reload. All the HTML, CSS and Javascript  files of the SPA are downloaded by the browser initially, the DOM is created and then saved in the memory. This improves the speed and performance of the application. </div>

            </div>
            <h3>Multi-page Application</h3>
            <div>
               Multi Page Applications have multiple web pages that will be retrieved from the server upon request from the browser. 
               <div>
               Example, In a E -Commerce websiteWhen a user  clicks on the image of a product. 
               </div>
               
               Here 
               <li>The browser requests the server to provide the page about the product.</li> 
               <li> The Server renders a new page to the client which may have new set of HTML,CSS & Javascript files </li> 
               <li> THe browser loads the file and creates the DOM. </li>

            </div>
            <p style = "color: blue;">
            The main difference between the SPA and the MPA is the in the way the web pages are rendered. SPA design is applied when the application needs to be fast and requires one page. MPA design is applied when the application is complex hence needs multiple pages.
            </p>
            
        </p>
        <h2>Q3. What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
        
            <h3>Web Designer</h3>
             <div>Web Designer are professionals who designs the look and the feel of a web application. The usability & accessibility of the features, the layout of the web page, the color, font and the images are created by the Web Designer as Wireframes. </div>
            
            <h3>Front End Developer</h3>
             <div>Front end developers are IT Professionals who develop the User Interface of the application as per the Wire frames created by the Web Designer. They use front end programming languages like HTML,CSS, javascript and Packages like React or Angular to develop the user interface of the web application.  </div>
            <h3>Backend Developer</h3>
             <div>
                 Backend developers are IT professionals who develop web services / API's that are required to manipulate or update information between the client and the server. Example, when the user enters the information on a web page and saves, the web service is called to establish connections with a DB, to update the recent information. The back end developer codes this part of the application.
             </div>
        
             <h2>Q4. Read file relationships: (Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths).</h2>
             <h3>Site Relative</h3>
              <p>
                Site root-relative paths provide the path from the siteâ€™s root folder to a document.A site root-relative path begins with a leading forward slash, which stands for the site root folder. 
                Eg. /assets/img/slideshow/slide.jpg
              </p>

             <h3>Document Relative</h3>
               <p>
                   It is always relative to the current file we are working on.
                   ./resources/index.html
                   ./index.html - One directory upwards from the current directory
               </p>
             <h3>Absolute Paths</h3>
             <div>
                 <p>
                     The path with reference to root directory is called absolute.
                     Absolute paths include the domain name and mostly used to fetch files from other servers.
                 </p>
             </div>

             <h2>Final Project Description </h2>
             <h3>Chef's Corner</h3>
             
             <div>
                 <p>
                     The 'Chef's Corner' is a web application that intends to provide services to family run restaurants around the city. These family run businesses can update menu's frequently and take scheduled orders. It enables small restaurant owners to manage orders effectively and plan deliveries accurately.   
                 </p>
                 <p>I chose this subject becasue there is good scope to expand the application in a way that can cater to the customers directly. It includes login functionality for owners and customers, displays Current Menu's of each chef, gallery, deals and management of orders and deliveries. </p>
               
             </div>

             <h2>Q5. What it means for a company to be Agile. What is the purpose of using Agile, and its Pros and Cons.</h2>

             <div>
                 <p>Agile is a software development process in which work is planned for a sprint(usually 2 weeks), focusses on continuous development and feedback.

                    It involves collaboration within teams by sprint planning session, daily stand-ups and retrospective meetings. </p>

                 <p>The enitre feature is broken down in to small user stories. These user stories are ordered, developed, tested and finally accepted by the product owner.</p> 
            </div>
                 
                     <h3>Pros of Agile</h3>
                <div>
                <p> With immediate feedbacks, changes in requirements are effectively handled by creating user stories and adding it in backlog. They are then prioritized during the backlog and planning session before they are worked on. This helps in developing applications faster and improves customer satisfaction. It eliminates redundant documentation and delivers working software in short time.
                 </p>
                 </div>

                 
                      <h3>Cons of Agile</h3>
                    <div> <p>It is very difficult to plan and allocate resources required as the application may get complex.
                     
                 </p> </div>

                </h2>
            
                <h2>Q7.What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and SVG images?</h2>
                <h3>JPG</h3>
                  <div>
                    
                  </div>
                <h3>GIF</h3>
                  <div>
                    This bitmap format supports up to 8 bits per pixel which limits its color palette to 256. Not good for photographs an are mostly known these days for simply animated memes.
                   </div>
                <h3>PNG</h3>
                   <div>
                    PNG was designed for use on the Internet and is the most largely used image compression format on the web. PNGs are not for printing professional graphic images.
                   </div>
                <h3>SVG</h3>
                  <div>
                    SVGs are vector graphics that support animation and their behaviors are defined in XML files for they can be searched, indexed, scripted and compressed. Vector graphics are great for logos and line art because they aren't made from pixels and can be infinitely resized without losing quality or increasing in size. SVGs are your best option when creating icons and line art for high-resolution displays.
                   </div>

                   <h2>Q8. What are testing environments? What is the difference between Local, Dev, QA and Production?</h2>

                   <div>
                       <p>Test environement mimics the software and hardware of the real time application. It can include test test, databaseweb servers and OS. The development team uses this
                           environment to test the application before relaese to production. The test environment can be categorized as follows.

                           <h3>Local</h3>
                           <p>It is the developer's computer where the code exists. After making the necessary changes the developer performs unit tests on a section of code to check its corectness.</p>

                           <h3>Dev</h3>
                           <p>
                               After the unit test are done, the changes are pushed in to the Dev environment. It verifies the integration among different sysrems works properly. It doesnt completely 
                               mimic the prodiction environment. 
                           </p>

                           <h3>QA</h3>
                           <p>
                               QA environment is the environemnt where majority of the testing are performed. Smoke tests, integration and regression tests are performed through manually or automated test cases. Most companies have a separate 
                               staging environment which is the most stable and closer to the production environment.  
                           </p>

                           <h3>Production</h3>
                           <p>
                               The production environment is the actual real time application exists. Usually, business leaders create special accounts to test in real time environment to get a sense of user experience.
                           </p>
