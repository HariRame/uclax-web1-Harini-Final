        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>

        <p>
            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <div>HTML is the abbreviation of Hyper Text MarkUp Language. The browser orders or places the content as defined in the html page. The content can be text, images, list, links,icons,headings, paragraphs. The root element is the HTML tag. It contains the HEAD and the Body tags where the page title/heading and the content are placed respectively.

            Each element has attributes like Id, class and name that provides information about the element. </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <div>CSS is the abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets. It controls how the content will be displayed in the browser ie,. the font size, color, thickness of the  border and padding etc. The css can be defined in-line under the STYLE tag in the HTML document or defined in the .css file and then imported in the HTML file. 

            It is good practice to maintain basic page format across the website and the .css files helps acheive that.  
            <p></p>
                &lt;style&gt;
                <div>
                    div {
                     color:blue;
                }
                </div>
                &lt;/style&gt; 
            
            <p>The above style will be applied to all the DIV tags in the HTML page. </p>
            </div>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Javascript</h2>
           <div>Javascript is the language that is used to make the site dynamic by adding functionalities to the html elements or by changing the css of an element or changing the element itself. It can also manipulate the data provided by user (for validation before passing to the server ) or data provided by the server(To display relevant information in the browser). </div>
